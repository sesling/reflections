When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I'd want to use a remote repository if I planned to share my work with others, 
was worried about my local files being erased,
or if I had multiple computers that I worked from (for example, a home computer and a work computer.) 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

It seems like that would make changing something difficult, since automatically pulling would ensure that any changes you make would be reverted before you could push them. 
In addition, if other people were making changes to your github project, the project you are working on could suddenly pull all sorts of new changes you aren't familier with. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another? 

Clones simply involve making a duplicate of a repository.
A fork is a type of clone, confined to GitHub.
It involves cloning a repository from one account to another.
A branch is just a path of commits within a repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

It makes resolving conflicts between the local and GitHub branches more straightforward. 

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

I suppose I would be forced to either exchange emails, which would be 
	messy and inefficient, or use something like GoogleDocs, which isn't 
	built with coding in mind. On the plus side, I wouldn't have to learn
	how to use those methods, as I'm already familier with them.
