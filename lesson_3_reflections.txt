When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I'd want to use a remote repository if I planned to share my work with others, 
was worried about my local files being erased,
or if I had multiple computers that I worked from (for example, a home computer and a work computer.) 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

It seems like that would make changing something difficult, since automatically pulling would ensure that any changes you make would be reverted before you could push them. 
In addition, if other people were making changes to your github project, the project you are working on could suddenly pull all sorts of new changes you aren't familier with.
